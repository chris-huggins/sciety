  abstract: `<p>
  Our knowledge about the repertoire of ribosomal RNA modifications and the enzymes responsible for installing them is
  constantly expanding. Previously, we reported that NSUN-5 is responsible for depositing m<sup>5</sup>C at position
  C2381 on the 26S rRNA in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Here, we show that NSUN-1 is writing the second known 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C at position C2982. Depletion of
  <i>nsun-1</i> or <i>nsun-5</i> improved locomotion at midlife and resistance against heat stress, however, only
  soma-specific knockdown of <i>nsun-1</i> extended lifespan. Moreover, soma-specific knockdown of <i>nsun-1</i>
  reduced body size and impaired fecundity, suggesting non-cell-autonomous effects. While ribosome biogenesis and
  global protein synthesis were unaffected by <i>nsun-1</i> depletion, translation of specific mRNAs was remodelled
  leading to reduced production of collagens, loss of structural integrity of the cuticle and impaired barrier function.
</p>

<p>
  We conclude that loss of a single enzyme required for rRNA methylation has profound and highly specific effects on
  organismal physiology.
