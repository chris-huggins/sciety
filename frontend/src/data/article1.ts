  abstract: `<p>
  Our knowledge about the repertoire of ribosomal RNA modifications and the enzymes responsible for installing them is
  constantly expanding. Previously, we reported that NSUN-5 is responsible for depositing m<sup>5</sup>C at position
  C2381 on the 26S rRNA in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Here, we show that NSUN-1 is writing the second known 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C at position C2982. Depletion of
  <i>nsun-1</i> or <i>nsun-5</i> improved locomotion at midlife and resistance against heat stress, however, only
  soma-specific knockdown of <i>nsun-1</i> extended lifespan. Moreover, soma-specific knockdown of <i>nsun-1</i>
  reduced body size and impaired fecundity, suggesting non-cell-autonomous effects. While ribosome biogenesis and
  global protein synthesis were unaffected by <i>nsun-1</i> depletion, translation of specific mRNAs was remodelled
  leading to reduced production of collagens, loss of structural integrity of the cuticle and impaired barrier function.
</p>

<p>
  We conclude that loss of a single enzyme required for rRNA methylation has profound and highly specific effects on
  organismal physiology.

      summary: `While somatic and germline reduction of m<sup>5</sup>C levels do not have an impact on worm lifespan,
 it does increase resistance to heat stress, slight increase in motor activity. Reducing NSUN-1 expression separately
 in germline and soma showed allegedly lifespan increase. Somatic reduction of NSUN-1 leads to changes in body size,
 oocyte maturation and fecundity, and has no effect on global protein translation. Analysis of polysome enrichment
 for specific mRNAs revealed that worms with low levels of NSUN-1 have altered translation of transcripts involved
 in cuticle collagen deposition.`,

      summary: `Using RNAi in two worm strains, the authors show that knocking down NSUN-1 expression, the specific 
 C2982 m<sup>5</sup>C level is in part (not entirely) reduced. This assay proves sufficiency (but not necessity)
 of NSUN-1 to reduce m<sup>5</sup>C levels at C2982. While it is not clear why the authors do not use a
 complete knock out for NSUN-1 (is it lethal?), follow-up work using RNAi explores the phenotypic effects
 of lowered NSUN-1 levels.`,

      summary: `Heissenberger et al. study how NSUN-1 impacts rRNA methylation
 and health in nematodes. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs undergo several 
 modifications. Among these, there are two known m<sup>5</sup>C, located 
 in highly conserved target sequences. Previous work from the authors 
 characterised the mechanism underlying one of these modifications in 
 worms (C2381), as well as its functional consequences on cellular and 
 organismal homeostasis. The current work focuses on the second 
 m<sup>5</sup>C, at position C2982, and identifies NSUN-1 as the putative 
 rRNA methylase. This is a novel and potentially exciting finding.`,
