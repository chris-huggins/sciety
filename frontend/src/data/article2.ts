  The tumour suppressor PALB2 stimulates error-free repair of DNA breaks, whilst its steady-state chromatin association
  protects active genes from genotoxic stress. Here, we report that the lysine acetyltransferases 2A and 2B (KAT2A/B),
  commonly known to promote transcriptional activation, acetylate the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM),
  providing a dynamic regulatory mechanism for PALB2. ChAM acetylation within a cluster of seven lysine residues (7K),
  detected in the chromatin-enriched fraction in undamaged cells, enhanced its association with nucleosomes while
  decreasing its non-specific binding to naked DNA. DNA damage triggered a rapid deacetylation of ChAM and a concomitant
  increase in PALB2 mobility. Significantly, a 7K-null mutation, which hindered ChAM binding to both nucleosomes and
  DNA, conferred deficiency in DNA repair and hypersensitivity to the anti-cancer drug olaparib. Thus, our study reveals
  a unique mechanism mediated by KAT2A/B-dependent acetylation of a non-histone protein, which fine-tunes the DNA damage
  response and hence promotes genome stability.

      summary: `<p>
  The authors describe a series of experiments examining the consequence of acetylation, within a defined
  motif (Chromatin Association Motif; ChAM), on the cellular roles of the protein PALB2 (Partner and
  Localizer of BRCA2).
</p>

<p>
  The key conclusions drawn by the authors are generally convincing and are supported by the presented
  experimental results, which indicate that acetylation of PALB2 by KAT2A/KAT2B modulates its cellular
  behaviour and response to DNA damage.

      summary: `<p>
  This manuscript reports the control of PALB2 - chromatin interaction by the acetylation of a particular
  lysine-rich domain of the protein called ChAM. This acetylation is shown to be mediated by the
  acetyltransferases KAT2A/B. Following these investigations, the authors made an effort to place their
  findings in the context of DNA replication and DNA repair.

      summary: `<p>
  Fournier et al. detect acetylation within the chromatin association motif (ChAM) of PALB2 and demonstrate
  that KAT2 can acetylate these 7 lysine residues within this region. They then generate K to R mutations
  (7R) or K to Q mutations (7Q) at these sites and perform assays of fluorescence recovery after
  photobleaching (FRAP) to measure mobility as a measure of chromatin association, RAD51 foci, PALB2
  recruitment at sites of laser-induced DNA damage, and sensitivity to olaparib. They find increased
  mobility of the 7Q mutant of PALB2 but not 7R in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, as well as defects
  in DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci and resistance to olaparib. On this basis, the authors conclude that
  acetylation is required for the association of PALB2 with undamaged chromatin and that deacetylation
  permits mobilization and association with BRCA1 to enable proper DNA repair. While the manuscript is
  generally well-written, many of the systems are rather elegant, and this study may yield novel insights
  into the regulation and function of PALB2 in DNA repair, there are some missing experiments to be added
  and important contradictions that should be resolved in order to fully establish the new model the authors
  propose.
