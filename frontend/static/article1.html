        Abstract
      </h2>

      <p>
        Our knowledge about the repertoire of ribosomal RNA modifications and the enzymes responsible for installing
        them is constantly expanding. Previously, we reported that NSUN-5 is responsible for depositing m<sup>5</sup>C
        at position C2381 on the 26S rRNA in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, we show that NSUN-1 is writing the second known 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C at position C2982. Depletion of
        <i>nsun-1</i> or <i>nsun-5</i> improved locomotion at midlife and resistance against heat stress, however, only
        soma-specific knockdown of <i>nsun-1</i> extended lifespan. Moreover, soma-specific knockdown of <i>nsun-1</i>
        reduced body size and impaired fecundity, suggesting non-cell-autonomous effects. While ribosome biogenesis and
        global protein synthesis were unaffected by <i>nsun-1</i> depletion, translation of specific mRNAs was
        remodelled leading to reduced production of collagens, loss of structural integrity of the cuticle and impaired
        barrier function.
      </p>

      <p>
        We conclude that loss of a single enzyme required for rRNA methylation has profound and highly specific effects
        on organismal physiology.

            <p>
              Heissenberger et al. study how NSUN-1 impacts rRNA methylation and health in nematodes. Eukaryotic
              ribosomal RNAs undergo several modifications. Among these, there are two known m<sup>5</sup>C, located in
              highly conserved target sequences. Previous work from the authors characterised the mechanism underlying
              one of these modifications in worms (C2381), as well as its functional consequences on cellular and
              organismal homeostasis. The current work focuses on the second m<sup>5</sup>C, at position C2982, and
              identifies NSUN-1 as the putative rRNA methylase. This is a novel and potentially exciting finding.

            <p>
              Using RNAi in two worm strains, the authors show that knocking down NSUN-1 expression, the specific C2982
              m<sup>5</sup>C level is in part (not entirely) reduced. This assay proves sufficiency (but not necessity)
              of NSUN-1 to reduce m<sup>5</sup>C levels at C2982. While it is not clear why the authors do not use a
              complete knock out for NSUN-1 (is it lethal?), follow-up work using RNAi explores the phenotypic effects
              of lowered NSUN-1 levels.

            <p>
              While somatic and germline reduction of m<sup>5</sup>C levels do not have an impact on worm lifespan, it
              does increase resistance to heat stress, slight increase in motor activity. Reducing NSUN-1 expression
              separately in germline and soma showed allegedly lifespan increase. Somatic reduction of NSUN-1 leads to
              changes in body size, oocyte maturation and fecundity, and has no effect on global protein translation.
              Analysis of polysome enrichment for specific mRNAs revealed that worms with low levels of NSUN-1 have
              altered translation of transcripts involved in cuticle collagen deposition.
