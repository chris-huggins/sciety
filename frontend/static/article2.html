        Abstract
      </h2>

      <p>
        The tumour suppressor PALB2 stimulates error-free repair of DNA breaks, whilst its steady-state chromatin
        association protects active genes from genotoxic stress. Here, we report that the lysine acetyltransferases 2A
        and 2B (KAT2A/B), commonly known to promote transcriptional activation, acetylate the PALB2 chromatin
        association motif (ChAM), providing a dynamic regulatory mechanism for PALB2. ChAM acetylation within a cluster
        of seven lysine residues (7K), detected in the chromatin-enriched fraction in undamaged cells, enhanced its
        association with nucleosomes while decreasing its non-specific binding to naked DNA. DNA damage triggered a
        rapid deacetylation of ChAM and a concomitant increase in PALB2 mobility. Significantly, a 7K-null mutation,
        which hindered ChAM binding to both nucleosomes and DNA, conferred deficiency in DNA repair and hypersensitivity
        to the anti-cancer drug olaparib. Thus, our study reveals a unique mechanism mediated by KAT2A/B-dependent
        acetylation of a non-histone protein, which fine-tunes the DNA damage response and hence promotes genome
        stability.

              The authors describe a series of experiments examining the consequence of acetylation, within a defined
              motif (Chromatin Association Motif; ChAM), on the cellular roles of the protein PALB2 (Partner and
              Localizer of BRCA2).
            </p>

            <p>
              The key conclusions drawn by the authors are generally convincing and are supported by the presented
              experimental results, which indicate that acetylation of PALB2 by KAT2A/KAT2B modulates its cellular
              behaviour and response to DNA damage.

              This manuscript reports the control of PALB2 - chromatin interaction by the acetylation of a particular
              lysine-rich domain of the protein called ChAM. This acetylation is shown to be mediated by the
              acetyltransferases KAT2A/B. Following these investigations, the authors made an effort to place their
              findings in the context of DNA replication and DNA repair.

            <p>
              Fournier et al. detect acetylation within the chromatin association motif (ChAM) of PALB2 and demonstrate
              that KAT2 can acetylate these 7 lysine residues within this region. They then generate K to R mutations
              (7R) or K to Q mutations (7Q) at these sites and perform assays of fluorescence recovery after
              photobleaching (FRAP) to measure mobility as a measure of chromatin association, RAD51 foci, PALB2
              recruitment at sites of laser-induced DNA damage, and sensitivity to olaparib. They find increased
              mobility of the 7Q mutant of PALB2 but not 7R in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, as well as defects
              in DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci and resistance to olaparib. On this basis, the authors conclude that
              acetylation is required for the association of PALB2 with undamaged chromatin and that deacetylation
              permits mobilization and association with BRCA1 to enable proper DNA repair. While the manuscript is
              generally well-written, many of the systems are rather elegant, and this study may yield novel insights
              into the regulation and function of PALB2 in DNA repair, there are some missing experiments to be added
              and important contradictions that should be resolved in order to fully establish the new model the authors
              propose.
