        <h1>Ral GTPases promote metastasis by controlling biogenesis and organ colonization of exosomes</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs) mainly exert pro-tumoral functions by changing the phenotypes of stromal cells to the benefit of tumor growth and metastasis. They shuttle to distant organs and fertilize pre-metastatic niches facilitating subsequent seeding by circulating tumor cells. The levels of tumor secreted EVs correlate with tumor aggressiveness, however, the link between EV secretion mechanisms and their capacity to form pre-metastatic   niches remains obscure. Here, we show that GTPases of the Ral family control, through the phospholipase D1, multi-vesicular bodies homeostasis and thereby tune the biogenesis and secretion of pro-metastatic EVs. RalA and RalB promote lung metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. Importantly, EVs from RalA or RalB depleted cells have limited organotropic capacities in vivo and, as a consequence, are less efficient in promoting lung metastasis. RalA or RalB modulate the EV levels of the adhesion molecule MCAM/CD146, which mediates lung colonization. Finally, RalA and RalB, but also MCAM/CD146, are factors of poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients. Altogether, our study identifies Ral GTPases as central molecules linking the mechanisms of EVs secretion, cargo loading to their capacity to disseminate and induce pre-metastatic niches.</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes as factors potentiating metastasis by solid tumors has attracted considerable recent interest. The article by Ghoroghi et al is a very complete and thorough study of the role of 2 small GTPases, RalA and RalB, in extracellular vesicle (EV) release and breast carcinoma progression. The main advance of this manuscript is to describe a signaling role for the GTPases RalA and RalB in regulating phospholipase D (PLD) and multivesicular body function to regulate exosome biogenesis. They also show that RalA and RalB regulate expression of MCAM/CD146 on EVs, and that reduced levels of CD146 on EVs affects efficiency of lung cancer metastasis. Finally, they show RalA, RalB and CD146 levels are indicators poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Overall these are interesting observations with clinical relevance. The study is extremely carefully performed, in general, with appropriate controls and conclusions. There are a limited number of weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p>
