## Summary

eLife is a selective journal that publishes promising research in all areas of biology and medicine.

## Peer review model

eLifeâ€™s editorial process emphasises the production of clear, transparent public reviews of papers already posted as preprints, to transform unrefereed author manuscripts into refereed preprints.

Authors who proceed with a revised submission are expected to agree to have the public reviews posted to a preprint server. For articles that are rejected after peer review, authors maintain control over when public reviews are posted, and can delay having the public reviews posted until their work has been accepted for publication by another journal.
