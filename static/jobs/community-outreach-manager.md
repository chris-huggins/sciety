Sciety is a platform for research communication where new research results in biology, medicine and other sciences are made available for peer review and curation by different expert communities. It is built and operated by a small team at eLife Sciences Publications Limited.

Communities of discipline experts, academic societies, journal editors, early-career reviewers, or institution- and department-level teams can share expert reviews of new findings and help readers to navigate the expanding volume of literature made openly available every day. We have communities like eLife, PREReview, Review Commons and Peer Community as examples of those already on board.

We are now seeking a Community and Outreach Manager to help us change behaviour in scholarly communication to make it more open, diverse and trustworthy. We want to grow the usage and influence of the platform by talking to new communities, helping existing communities and finding groups of readers and authors to use it.

## Our Team
You’ll join a small and enthusiastic cross-functional team who are passionate about continuous improvement and building tools to enable positive change. Everyone gets involved in all aspects of the platform, with our group of eight staff regularly discussing the next software feature to experiment with, based on user feedback. You’ll represent the needs of communities in those conversations and choose the metrics we use to measure engagement. You’ll also assist our Product Manager and the rest of the team in promoting the platform to potential users through a variety of channels.

The distributed team works remotely in a very sociable way. Most of the software development takes place on a single video call with others joining occasionally to provide input and join the conversation. We also have a regular “campfire” session where we learn about each other and share team folklore to improve our shared understanding of what we’re building and how. The team constantly adapts to meet the needs of its members: we meet briefly at the beginning and end of every day, always looking to make improvements to our process and practices. We also have a number of ways to reserve time for self-directed and team-based learning.
