There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.</p>',

Many bacterial species exhibit non-genetic adaptive resistance to a broad range of antibiotics only when swarming (SR)<sup><a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>-<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. While the swarming population as a whole survives antibiotic challenge, it nonetheless sustains considerable cell death<sup><a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. In this study focused mainly on <em>E. coli</em>, an initial analysis of antibiotic-induced killing patterns of swarm vs planktonic cells indicated that death of a sub-population is beneficial to the swarm in promoting SR. Introduction of pre-killed cells into a swarm indeed enhanced SR, allowing us to purify the SR factor from killed cells, and to establish that cell death is directly involved in SR. The SR-enhancing factor was identified to be AcrA, a periplasmic component of a tripartite RND efflux pump<sup><a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, of which the outer membrane component TolC is shared by multiple drug efflux pumps<sup><a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. We show that AcrA stimulates drug efflux in live cells by interacting with TolC from the outside. This stimulus acts as a signal to activate efflux in the short term, and to induce the expression of other classes of efflux pumps in the long term, amplifying the response and establishing SR. We call this phenomenon ‘necrosignaling’, and show the existence of species-specific necrosignaling in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Our results have implications for the adaptive resistance of other surface-associated bacterial collectives such as biofilms. Given that such resistance is known to be an incubator for evolving genetic resistance<sup><a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>, our findings may also be relevant to chemotherapy-resistant cancers.</p>',
  '10.1101/845081': '<p id="p-2">Several lipids of the pathogen <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> are known to promote virulence at various stages of disease. However, the inability to probe these lipids during in vivo infection makes elucidation of their pathogenic mechanisms difficult. Using chemical extraction and reconstitution methods, we were able to define the lipid composition of the outer mycomembrane of <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em> prior to infection. Combining this approach with the synthesis of clickable, semi-synthetic lipids, we introduced a chemically tractable, biologically active variant of the virulence lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) into the mycomembrane. We find that following infection of zebrafish larvae, PDIM spreads away from bacterial surfaces into the membranes of both macrophage and epithelial cells that it contacts. This spreading facilitates PDIM’s role in preventing bacterium-detrimental immune activation at the site of infection.</p>',
  '10.1101/823989': '<p id="p-2">The discovery of new viruses currently outpaces our capacity for experimental examination of infection biology. To better couple virus discovery with immunology, we genetically modified zebrafish to visually report on virus infections. After generating a strain that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under an interferon-stimulated gene promoter, we repeatedly observed transgenic larvae spontaneously expressing GFP days after hatching. RNA sequencing of GFP-positive zebrafish revealed a picornavirus distantly related to known viruses. We detected this virus in publicly available sequencing data from seemingly asymptomatic zebrafish in research institutes world-wide. These data revealed widespread tissue tropism and identified the clonal CG2 strain as notably vulnerable to picornavirus infection. Infection induces the expression of numerous antiviral immune defense genes in zebrafish, an effect also evident in public data. Our study describes a prevalent picornavirus that infects zebrafish, and provides new strategies for simultaneously discovering viruses and their impact on vertebrate hosts.</p>',
  '10.1101/380238': '<p id="p-3">Tumor extracellular vesicles (tumor EVs) mediate the communication between tumor and stromal cells mostly to the benefit of tumor progression. Notably, tumor EVs have been reported to travel in the blood circulation, reach specific distant organs and locally modify the microenvironment. However, visualizing these events <em>in vivo</em> still faces major hurdles. Here, we show a new method for tracking individual circulating tumor EVs in a living organism: we combine novel, bright and specific fluorescent membrane probes, MemBright, with the transparent zebrafish embryo as an animal model. We provide the first description of tumor EVs’ hemodynamic behavior and document their arrest before internalization. Using transgenic lines, we show that circulating tumor EVs are uptaken by endothelial cells and blood patrolling macrophages, but not by leukocytes, and subsequently stored in acidic degradative compartments. Finally, we prove that the MemBright can be used to follow naturally released tumor EVs <em>in vivo</em>. Overall, our study demonstrates the usefulness and prospects of zebrafish embryo to track tumor EVs <em>in vivo</em>.</p>',
