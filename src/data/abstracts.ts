  '10.1101/2020.03.22.002386': '<p id="p-2">An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption<sup><a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.</p>',
  '10.1101/2020.02.26.966986': '<p id="p-2">Swarming is form of collective bacterial motion enabled by flagella on the surface of semi-solid media<sup><a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. Many bacterial species exhibit non-genetic adaptive resistance to a broad range of antibiotics only when swarming (SR)<sup><a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>-<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. While the swarming population as a whole survives antibiotic challenge, it nonetheless sustains considerable cell death<sup><a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. In this study focused mainly on <em>E. coli</em>, an initial analysis of antibiotic-induced killing patterns of swarm vs planktonic cells indicated that death of a sub-population is beneficial to the swarm in promoting SR. Introduction of pre-killed cells into a swarm indeed enhanced SR, allowing us to purify the SR factor from killed cells, and to establish that cell death is directly involved in SR. The SR-enhancing factor was identified to be AcrA, a periplasmic component of a tripartite RND efflux pump<sup><a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, of which the outer membrane component TolC is shared by multiple drug efflux pumps<sup><a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. We show that AcrA stimulates drug efflux in live cells by interacting with TolC from the outside. This stimulus acts as a signal to activate efflux in the short term, and to induce the expression of other classes of efflux pumps in the long term, amplifying the response and establishing SR. We call this phenomenon ‘necrosignaling’, and show the existence of species-specific necrosignaling in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Our results have implications for the adaptive resistance of other surface-associated bacterial collectives such as biofilms. Given that such resistance is known to be an incubator for evolving genetic resistance<sup><a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>, our findings may also be relevant to chemotherapy-resistant cancers.</p>',
