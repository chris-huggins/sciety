    <p>eLife is a non-profit organisation created by funders and led by researchers. Our mission
      is to accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research communication that
      encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours.</p>
    <h2 class="ui header" id="peer-review-model">Peer review model</h2>
    <p>eLife works to improve the process of peer review so that it more effectively conveys the
      assessment of expert reviewers to authors, readers and other interested parties. This
      ambition is reflected in the transparency of our current process, where anyone can read the
      peer review reports and editors&#39; assessment for all published eLife papers. In the
      future we envision a system in which the outputs of peer review are the primary way research
      is assessed, rather than journal title.</p>
    <p>The main features of the current eLife peer-review process are:
    <ul>
      <li>all decisions are made by editors who are active researchers in the life and
            biomedical sciences.</li>
      <li>editors and reviewers discuss their reviews with each other before reaching a
            decision on a manuscript; extra experiments are only requested if they are essential
            and can be completed within about two months.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The overall aim is to make peer review faster (by reducing rounds of revision and only
      requesting extra experiments when they are essential), fairer and more open. eLife does not
      support the Impact Factor and is a co-founder of the Declaration on Research Assessment
      (DORA).</p>

    <p>PREreview's mission is to bring more diversity to scholarly peer review by supporting and empowering 
    community of researchers, particularly those at early stages of their career (ECRs) to review preprints.</p>
    <p>We envision a system in which any researcher, regardless of their prior engagement with journal-organized
     peer review, career level, geographical location, institutional affiliation, research field, gender, sexual 
     orientation, and ability is invited to share openly constructive feedback on early version of research 
     manuscripts shared as preprints on any web server.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="ui header" id="peer-review-model">Peer review model</h2>
    <p>At PREreview we believe all researchers should be allowed to help others by reviewing the work of their 
     peers, as long as it is done constructively.</p>
    <p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, 
     pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
     regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
     nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>
    <p>We believe it is our duty as scientists at any level of our career to contribute to scientific evaluation 
     in the form of peer review. PREreview provides a space for any researcher, independently of their career level,
     to provide feedback to emerging scientific output.</p>
    <p>At PREreview we ask all contributors to disclose any competing interest (CI) that may exist between a rapid
     review author (or affiliated  organization) and the author(s) (or affiliated organization) of the reviewed

    <p><a href="https://peerj.org/">PeerJ</a> is an open access publisher of 7 peer-reviewed journals, and an editorial 
    community of over 2000 Academic Editors and Advisors, and tens of thousands of authors and reviewers.</p>
    <h2 class="ui header" id="peer-review-model">Peer review model</h2>
    <p>PeerJ's editorial model is based on post-publication peer review history transparency, with peer review 
     history dates and formal decisions made available on publication. When a manuscript is accepted for publication,
     reviewers have the option to sign their review, and authors have the option to publish the full peer review 
     history alongside their paper. More than 80% of authors make their peer review publicly available, and around
     40% of reviewers choose to sign their review.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2013, PeerJ Preprints published over 5000 preprints. The rise in popularity of bioRxiv and other 
     preprints servers meant the academic community was well-served with alternative preprint venue options, and led 
     to the decision to cease accepting new submissions to PeerJ Preprints at the end of 2019. All preprints remain 
     readable and downloadable at <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints">peerj.com/preprints</a>. PeerJ continues 
     to work with preprint servers to facilitate direct submissions to our journals, as well as continuing to encourage,
     via our <a href="https://peerj.com/about/FAQ/academic-contribution/">Contributions</a> system, uptake of open 
     review and open Q&A on our articles.

    <p>Review Commons is a platform for high-quality journal-independent peer-review in the life sciences.</p>

    <p>Review Commons provides authors with a Refereed Preprint, which includes the authors’ manuscript, reports from a 
    single round of peer review and the authors’ response. Review Commons also facilitates author-directed submission of 
    Refereed Preprints to affiliate journals to expedite editorial consideration, reduce serial re-review and streamline publication.</p>
    
    <p>Review Commons transfers Refereed Preprints on behalf of the authors to bioRxiv and 17 affiliate journals from EMBO Press, eLife, ASCB, 
    The Company of Biologists, Rockefeller University Press and PLOS.</p>
    
    <p>Review Commons will:
      <ul>
        <li>Allow reviewers to focus on the science, not specific journal fit.</li>
        <li>Enrich the value of preprints.</li>
        <li>Reduce re-reviewing at multiple journals.</li>
        <li>Accelerate the publishing process by providing journals with high-quality referee reports.</li>

    <h2 class="ui header" id="peer-review-model">Peer review model</h2>
    <p>An independent Managing Editor will liaise with the authors and assign experienced professional editors at EMBO Press to run a high-quality, 
    in-depth peer-review process. The EMBO editors will only invite referees, but not assess the manuscript for their journals. 
    Reviewers may co-review manuscripts with colleagues, e.g. members of their research groups.</p>

    <p>The primary purpose of the peer-review process at Review Commons is to provide an in-depth analysis of a scientific study in order to help the 
    authors improve their paper by strengthening the rigor of the work and the clarity of the presentation.</p>
    
    <p>Review Commons also requests reviewers to assess how the study advances the field rather than establishing its fit for a particular journal. 
    The reviews should be scholarly in tone and content will be made public (by default without referee names) unless the authors opt out. 
    As such, reviews should also be useful to all potential readers to better understand the work and its context and to journal editors to make informed decisions.</p>
    
    <p>The technology, workflow and policies of Review Commons are expected to evolve with time. A versioned record of Frequently Asked Questions 
    and other guidelines is kept in the repository <a href="http://github.com/review-commons">http://github.com/review-commons</a>. </p>

    description: `<h2 class="ui header" id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>Peer Community in Zoology (PCI Zoology) has been launched in July 2020, replacing and broadening the scope of PCI Entomology. 
    It is a community of recommenders playing the role of editors who recommend unpublished articles based on peer-reviews to make them complete, reliable and citable articles, without the need for publication in ‘traditional’ journals. Evaluation and recommendation by PCI Zoology are free of charge. 
    When a recommender decides to recommend an article, he/she writes a recommendation text that is published along with all the editorial correspondence (reviews, recommender's decisions, authors’ replies) by PCI Zoology. The article itself is not published by PCI Zoology; 
    it remains in the preprint server where it has been posted by the authors. PCI Zoology recommenders can also recommend, but to a lesser extent, postprints.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PCI Zoology is a community of the parent project Peer Community In, an original idea of Denis Bourguet, Benoit Facon and Thomas Guillemaud.</li>
      <li>PCI Zoology is not designed to be a free peer-reviewing service for authors aiming to improve their articles before submission to a journal. It is, of course, possible, for authors to then submit their recommended article to a traditional journal, but this is not the goal of PCI Zoology.</li>
      <li>PCI Zoology is stimulating: it recommends remarkable articles.</li>
      <li>PCI Zoology is free: there are no fees associated with the evaluation process, and no charge for access to the comments and recommendations. The website is freely accessible.</li>
      <li>PCI Zoology is transparent: Reviews and recommendations (for unpublished articles) and recommendations (for published articles) are freely available for consultation. Recommendations are signed by the recommenders. Reviews may also be signed if the reviewers agree to do so.</li>
      <li>PCI Zoology is not exclusive: An article may be recommended by different Peer Communities in X (a feature of particular interest for articles relating to multidisciplinary studies) and may even be published in a traditional journal (although this is not the goal of PCI Zoology).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ui header" id="peer-review-model">Peer review model</h2>
    <h3>Which manuscripts can be recommended?</h3>
 
    <p>PCI Zoology will recommend preprints, and to a lesser extent postprints, dealing with all aspects of fundamental and applied research (anatomy, behavior, developmental biology, ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics and physiology) on all animal taxa. This PCI will focus on animals from natural populations, from sponges and invertebrates to vertebrates, both in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The preprints recommended may describe empirical or theoretical studies, and be based on observations from experiments or nature, or previously acquired data. They may also report the results of verbal, computer or mathematical models. Studies of methodologies for zoology as well as interdisciplinary research with innovative ideas are appreciated. Perspectives, reviews and opinions, as well as comments on previously published articles are also welcome. PCI Zoology can consider purely taxonomic preprints but it is noteworthy that a new taxon name is only valid if the name and description are published by an identified publisher (ISSN) in a classic journal with a single doi. For work on domestic animal species and animals managed by humans, please consider PCI Animal Science.  </p>

    <p>The articles recommended may have diverse formats: reviews, comments, opinion papers, research articles, data papers, technical notes, computer notes, movies, etc. No editing, formatting or proofing of the recommended papers is required. We only ask the authors of recommended article to add a cover page to their article and a sentence at the beginning of the abstract stating that their article has been recommended by PCI Zoology.</p>  
    
    <p>PCI Zoology welcomes anonymous submissions (see <a href="https://zool.peercommunityin.org/about/help_generic/for%20authors">details</a>).</p>
    <p>PCI Zoology also welcomes submissions of preregistrations (see <a href="https://zool.peercommunityin.org/about/help_practical#To%20submit%20a%20preregistration%20of%20a%20study">details</a>).</p>
    
    <h3>Editorial Criteria</h3>
        
    <p>PCI Zoology recommends only preprints of high scientific quality that are methodologically and ethically sound. To this end, PCI Zoology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires data, computer codes and mathematical and statistical analysis scripts to be made available to reviewers and recommenders at the time of submission and to readers after recommendation.</li>
      <li>Welcomes reproductions of studies.</li>
      <li>Welcomes preregistration submissions and preprint submissions based on preregistrations (whether or not reviewed)</li>
      <li>Welcomes preprints reporting negative results, provided that the questions addressed and the methodology are sound.</li>
      <li>Does not accept submissions of preprints presenting financial conflicts of interest. Other conflicts of interest must be minimal and declared.</li>
      <li>Ensures that, as far as possible, the reviewers and referees have no conflict of interest with the content or authors of the study being evaluated.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>PCI Zoology does not guarantee the evaluation or recommendation of all submitted preprints. Only preprints considered interesting by at least one competent recommender (equivalent to an associate editor in a classical journal) will be peer-reviewed. The interest of the preprint, as determined by the recommender, can relate to its context, the scientific question addressed, the methodology, or the results. PCI Zoology has a large number of recommenders, ensuring a considerable diversity of interests. The recommendations published by PCI Zoology are designed to draw the attention of the research community to the qualities of the article, including the subjective reasons for the recommender’s interest in it.</p>
