# Local changes below
#




## Use the below to avoid proxy-chaining
always_direct allow all
## Always complete the server-side handshake before client-side (recommended)
ssl_bump bump all
## Prior to squid 3.5 it was done like this:
#ssl_bump server-first all
## Allow server side certificate errors such as untrusted certificates, otherwise the connection is closed for such errors
sslproxy_cert_error allow all
## Or maybe deny all server side certificate errors according to your company policy
#sslproxy_cert_error deny all
## Accept certificates that fail verification (should only be needed if using 'sslproxy_cert_error allow all')
#sslproxy_flags DONT_VERIFY_PEER

## Modify the http_port directive to perform SSL interception
## Ensure to point to the cert/key created earlier
## Disable SSLv2 because it isn't safe
http_port 3128 ssl-bump cert=/etc/squid/squid.crt key=/etc/squid/squid.key options=NO_SSLv2
